In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to bulk delete all the existing completed todos by using GraphQL Mutations.

Let's define a graphql query to do a mutation into todos. In the file `src/graphql-operations/index.ts`, add the following:

```ts
export const DELETE_TODOS = gql`
    mutation delete_todos($where: todos_bool_exp!) {
        delete_todos(where: $where) {
            affected_rows
        }
    }
`
```

You will also need to pass in the values for the variables.

[Try](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql) this mutation in GraphiQL against the application database to see what the response looks like.

Let's now integrate this graphql mutation into our vue app.
