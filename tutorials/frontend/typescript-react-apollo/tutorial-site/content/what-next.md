Congratulations! You have successfully completed the course.

In case you are wondering what to do next, you have the following options:

## Take the Hasura backend course
We have an [Introduction to Hasura](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) backend course to build the backend that you just used for your react app.

## Join Discord for Support
We have a Discord Channel for those who are new to GraphQL. Please post your queries or feedback regarding this course. It is a pretty active channel.

Here's the [invite link](https://discord.com/invite/hasura) to join discord.

## More sample apps
We have a bunch of sample apps created using React, Apollo Client and Hasura GraphQL Engine.

Check out the [sample apps](https://hasura.io/sample-apps) to get a taste of how realtime GraphQL and Auth work with Hasura. We also have boilerplates to help you get started quickly with React and Apollo.
