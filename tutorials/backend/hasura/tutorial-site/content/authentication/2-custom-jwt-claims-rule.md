metaDescription: "Custom Claims inside the JWT are used to tell Hasura about the role of the caller, so that Hasura may enforce the necessary authorization rules to decide what the caller can and cannot do."
---

[Custom claims](https://auth0.com/docs/scopes/current/custom-claims) inside the JWT are used to tell Hasura about the role of the caller, so that Hasura may enforce the necessary authorization rules to decide what the caller can and cannot do.
In the Auth0 dashboard, navigate to [Rules](https://manage.auth0.com/#/rules). 

Click on the `+ Create Rule` button. In the next screen, select the `Empty rule` template.

Name the rule as `hasura-jwt-claims`.

Add the following script to the rule.

```javascript
function (user, context, callback) {
  const namespace = "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims";
  context.accessToken[namespace] =
    {
      'x-hasura-default-role': 'user',
      // do some custom logic to decide allowed roles
      'x-hasura-allowed-roles': ['user'],
      'x-hasura-user-id': user.user_id
    };
  callback(null, user, context);
}
```
