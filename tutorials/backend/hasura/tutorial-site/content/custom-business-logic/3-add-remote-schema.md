We have written the custom resolver and deployed it to Glitch. We have the GraphQL endpoint ready. Let's add it to Hasura as a remote schema.

## Add

Head to the `Remote Schemas` tab of the console and click on the `Add` button.

Give a name for the remote schema (let's say auth0).
Under GraphQL Server URL, enter the glitch app url that you just deployed in the previous step.

Select `Forward all headers from the client` and click on `Add Remote Schema`.

## Try it out

Head to the Console GraphiQL tab and explore the following GraphQL query.

```graphql
query {
  auth0 {
    email
    picture
  }
}
```

Remember the JWT token that we got after configuring Auth0 and testing it out? Here you also need to pass in the `Authorization` header with the same JWT token to get the right data.

As you can see, Hasura has merged the custom GraphQL schema with the already existing auto-generated APIs over Postgres.
