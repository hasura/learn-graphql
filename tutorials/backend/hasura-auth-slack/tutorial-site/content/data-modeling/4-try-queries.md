As you are aware that Hasura gives you Instant GraphQL APIs over [Postgres](https://hasura.io/learn/database/postgresql/what-is-postgresql/), it can be tested on [the table that we just created](https://hasura.io/learn/database/postgresql/create-alter-drop-ddl/1-postgresql-create/).

Let's go ahead and start exploring the GraphQL APIs for `users` table.

## Mutation {#mutation}

Head over to Console -> GRAPHIQL tab and insert a user using [GraphQL Mutations](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/graphql-mutations/).

```graphql
mutation {
  insert_users(objects:[{name:"Praveen", email: "myemail@example.com", password: "password123"}]) {
    affected_rows
  }
}
```

Click on the `Play` button on the GraphiQL interface to execute the query.

You should get a response looking something like this:

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "insert_users": {
      "affected_rows": 1
    }
  }
}
```

Great! You have now consumed the mutation query for the `users` table that you just created. Easy isn't it?

**Tip**: You can use the `Explorer` on the GraphiQL interface to generate the mutation in a few clicks.

## Query {#query}

Now let's go ahead and [query](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/queries/index/) the data that we just inserted.

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    created_at
  }
}
```

You should get a response looking something like this:

![User Query](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/graphql-query-user.png)

Note that some columns like `created_at` have default values, even though you did not insert them during the mutation.

## Subscription {#subscription}

Let's run a [subscription](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/subscriptions/index/) query over `users` table to watch for changes to the table.

```graphql
subscription {
  users {
    id
    name
    created_at
  }
}
```

Initially the subscription query will return the existing results in the response.

Now let's insert new data into the users table and see the changes appearing in the response.

In a new tab, Head over to Console -> DATA tab -> users -> Insert Row and insert another row.

And switch to the previous `GRAPHIQL` tab and see the subscription response returning 2 results.

![User Subscription](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/graphql-subscription-user.png)

An active subscription query will keep returning the latest set of results depending on the query.
