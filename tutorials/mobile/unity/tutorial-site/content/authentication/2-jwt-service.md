Since setting up Auth0 or Firebase with Unity is a process in itself, we'd be setting up our own custom jwt provider!

It doesn't have the many useful features but it gets the job done. Let's get into it.

### Glitch Set Up

I already created a Glitch project for this. You'll just be cloning it and editing it a bit.

Open the link here:  https://glitch.com/edit/#!/shooter-arena-jwt

Click `Remix To Edit` to make it your own project. It should be at the top right corner.

**Note**: it is advisable you create a Glitch account, if not your project would be deleted after 5 days.

Go to `index.js` file and in `function postRequest(id, success)` change the `hostname` to your hasura backend url.

![Hostname](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-unity/authentication/url-change.jpg)

You can get your hostname from your Hasura console.

Next up, go to the `.env` file to set your secrets.

```text
SECRET=ADMIN_SECRET
CLIENT_TOKEN=CLIENT_TOKEN
PRIVATE_KEY=JWTSecretMustBeAtLeast32CharactersLong!
```

`SECRET` should be set to your Hasura admin secret
`CLIENT_TOKEN` should be set to a phrase you want to use to authorize Unity.
`PRIVATE_KEY` should be set to the HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET you set in Heroku.

Next, rename your project.

Copy the live app link.

And let's head over to Unity.

### Getting our JWT

Open your Unity project and create a new `Api Reference`. You can name it `JWT`

Paste the Glitch live app link you copied in the url slot and `Introspect`.

![Introspect](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-unity/authentication/jwt-api-reference.jpg)

Create a new query called `GetJwt`

![GetJwt](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-unity/authentication/get-jwt.jpg)

And that's it. Calling this query with the right arguments will return a jwt for us to authenticate our Api calls with.
