---

This course is meant to be taken by users of Hasura who want to optimise their application for production use cases. If you are new to Hasura, head to the [Hasura Basics](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) tutorial to get a fair idea of setting up Hasura and leveraging the fundamental features before diving into this tutorial.

## What will I learn? {#what-will-i-learn}

This course will dive into some advanced topics and walk you through on using different Hasura Cloud features to go to production. You will learn how Hasura Cloud helps you go to production with advanced security and reliability features. The topics covered are:

1. Migrations and Metadata
2. Optimizing for Performance
3. Enhancing Security
4. Improving Reliability
5. Debugging

## What do I need to take this tutorial? {#what-do-i-need}

A local instance of Hasura will be used for some of the demos and hence `docker / docker-compose` is a pre-requisite. And of course your browser for managing the Hasura Cloud project. However, be assured that everything you do via the browser in this tutorial can be done via code, can be version controlled, if required.

We will be using the Hasura CLI for learning about the migrations and metadata workflow but we will set that up during that exercise.

## How long will this tutorial take? {#how-long}

We expect this to take about an hour.

*Note*: Some features of performance, security and reliability are available only on Hasura Cloud. The open source graphql-engine can be used for local development portions of this tutorial.
