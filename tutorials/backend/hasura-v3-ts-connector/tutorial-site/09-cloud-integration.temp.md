Going over the process of creating and deploying a project to Hasura DDN is beyond the scope of this course and
we don't want to go too off-track, but is covered in the Hasura Docs which you can
[check out here](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/getting-started/overview).

We have created and included a Hasura DDN metadata configuration in the 
[repo for this course](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-typescript-learn-course/blob/main/hasura/) which you can use to
test your API, query it and see album and artist results - all powered by your connector.

## Install Hasura CLI and start a tunnel

To run this connector you will need to [install the Hasura3 CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation/) and 
create a tunnel so that Hasura DDN can reach your local machine. You can do this by first starting the tunnel daemon, 
with `hasura3 daemon start` and then creating a tunnel with `hasura3 tunnel create localhost:8100`.

The command will return a hostname and port which you should enter into the 
`/hasura/subgraphs/default/dataconnectors/db.hml` file in place of where you see the value for the connector URL. Eg:

```yaml
definition:
  name: my_sqlite_connector
  url:
    singleUrl:
      value: https://tunnel-url-here
```

## Create a project on Hasura DDN

In the console run `hasura3 project create` to create a project on Hasura DDN and paste that project name in 
the `hasura/hasura.yaml` file in the `project` field. Eg:

```yaml
project: my-project-name
```

## Create a build

Now we can create a build and apply it with `hasura3 watch`. This will return a table like the following:

```text

```

Paste the Console URL in your browser to see a GraphiQL console for your Hasura graph. 

Now you can run a GraphQL query against your data to see it in action.

Success!

In the next section, we'll start to fill out some of the missing query functionality, beginning with `where` clauses.
