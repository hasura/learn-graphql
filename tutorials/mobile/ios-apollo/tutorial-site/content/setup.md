For this tutorial, the GraphQL backend and the basic app UI is already ready.
Our task will be to convert the "static" UI into a working realtime app.

### Clone and run the boilerplate

1. Clone the [learn-graphql](https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql) repo. Execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse git@github.com:hasura/learn-graphql.git

cd learn-graphql

git sparse-checkout init --cone

git sparse-checkout add tutorials/mobile/ios-apollo/app-boilerplate
```

2. Navigate to the `app-boilerplate` directory.

```bash
cd tutorials/mobile/ios-apollo/app-boilerplate
```

3. This project uses carthage for dependency resolution, so you would need carthage installed,

```bash
$ brew install carthage
```

or you can use pacakge installation from [Carthage Latest Release](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases)

4. Install dependencies with Carthage.

```bash
$ carthage update --platform iOS
```

5. Run the app in xcode and signup with auth0 to view the app

This is what you should see after the steps above:

### Load GraphiQL to play with your GraphQL APIs

1. Head to https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql
2. Log in (so that you can test the GraphQL APIs with a valid user token)

This is what you should see after the steps above:

### GraphQL Endpoint

We are going to make use of `https://hasura.io/learn/graphql` endpoint for making our GraphQL requests in the tutorial.

Now, if you want to run your own version of the above GraphQL endpoint, you can do so by following the Hasura Backend tutorial
