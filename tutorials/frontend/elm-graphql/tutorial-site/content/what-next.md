Congratulations! You have successfully completed the course. As an exercise, you may want to implement creating public todos. You can refer to the final version of the app [here](https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql/blob/master/tutorials/frontend/elm-graphql/app-final/src/Main.elm).

In case you are wondering what to do next, you have the following options:

## Take the Hasura backend course

We have an [Introduction to Hasura](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) backend course to build the backend that you just used for your elm app.

## Join Discord for Support

We have a Discord Channel for those who are new to GraphQL. Please post your queries or feedback regarding this course. It is a pretty active channel.

Here's the [invite link](https://discord.com/invite/hasura) to join discord.
