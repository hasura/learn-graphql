Now that the view has been created, we need a way to be able to fetch user information based on the `id` column of the view. Let's create a manual relationship from the view `online_users` to the table `users` using the `id column` of the view.

Head to Console -> Data -> online_users -> Relationships page.

Add a new relationship by choosing the relationship type to be `Object Relationship`. Enter the relationship name as `user`.
Select the configuration for the current column as `id` and the remote table would be `users` and the remote column would be `id` again.

We are mapping the current view's id column to users table's id column to create the relationship.

Let's explore the GraphQL APIs for the relationship created.

```
query {
  online_users {
    id
    last_seen
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Great! We are completely done with data modelling for the app.
