### Hasura Set Up

First off, we need to set up a couple of things before we can delve right in. 

To use Hasura Actions, we have to ensure the version of Hasura is v.1.2.0 or above. Let's update to the latest version.

Follow the instructions here: https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/deployment/heroku/updating.html#heroku-update

After successfully updating, let's head over to our `users` table to modify it a bit.

We shall be adding two columns:

- `wins` (Integer, non-nullable, default: 0)
- `losses` (Integer, non-nullable, default: 0)

Next, go to the `Permissions` tab and update the `Select` permission for the user role.

Now, we create an new Action.

Go to the `Actions` tab and create a new action.

In the Action Definition, put

```text
type Mutation {
  BattleComplete (
    id: Int!
  ): BattleCompleteOutput
}
```

In the new types definition, put

```text
type BattleCompleteOutput {
  status : String!
  message : String!
}
```

What this does is create a mutation action that takes in an Integer `id` as arguments and returns a `BattleCompleteOutput` object.

The `BattleCompleteOutput` is defined in the new types definition to contain two strings, `status` and `message`

### Glitch Set Up

We're going to host another little project on Glitch to do out logic when BattleComplete is called.

Open the [Glitch Project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/shooter-battle-complete) and click `Remix To Edit`

Go to `env` and set the `SECRET` to your ADMIN_SECRET

Great, rename the project appropriately and copy the link to the live app. 

That's all the set up for that. Let me explain a bit of what this Glitch project does.

#### Battle Complete Explanation

When we call the BattleComplete action in Hasura, we set the argument to be the `id` of the battle we want to complete. 

The Glitch projects gets the `battle` from Hasura, checks who wins by comparing `hitTargets.Length` with `defendedTargets.Length`.

Then it gets the two `users` in the battle from the `shooter_id` and `defender_id` of the `battle` and increases the `wins` column of the winner and `losses` column of the loser.

Then it deletes the `battle`. That's basically what the Glitch project does. Now let's connect it to our Hasura Action.

#### Connect To Hasura

Go back to the Hasura console and open the action we created. In the `handler`, paste the link to the Glitch live app + /battleComplete.

for example, if the link is `https://glitch.com/edit/#!/shooter-battle-complete`, we'll set the handler to `https://glitch.com/edit/#!/shooter-battle-complete/battleComplete`

That's it for setting up the action!
