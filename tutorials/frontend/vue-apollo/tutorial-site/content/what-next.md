Congratulations! You have completed the course.

In case you are wondering what to do next, you have the following options:

## Take the Hasura backend course
 We have an [Introduction to Hasura](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) backend course to build the backend that you just used for your Vue app.

## Join Discord for Support
We have a Discord Channel for those who are new to GraphQL. Please post your queries or feedback regarding this course. It is a pretty active channel.

Here's the [invite link](https://discord.com/invite/hasura) to join discord.

## More boilerplates
We have a bunch of sample apps created using Vue, Apollo Client, and Hasura GraphQL Engine.

Check out the [vue-graphql](https://hasura.io/vue-graphql/) page to get a taste of how real-time GraphQL and Auth work with Hasura. We also have boilerplates to help you get started quickly with Vue and Apollo.
