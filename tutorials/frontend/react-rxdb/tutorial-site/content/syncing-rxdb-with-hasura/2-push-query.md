For the push query we use an upsert:

```js
    const pushQueryBuilder = doc => {
        const query = `
            mutation InsertTodo($todo: [todos_insert_input!]!) {
                insert_todos(
                    objects: $todo,
                    on_conflict: {
                        constraint: todos_pkey,
                        update_columns: [text, isCompleted, deleted, updatedAt]
                    }){
                    returning {
                    id
                    }
                }
        }
        `;
        const variables = {
            todo: doc
        };

        return {
            query,
            variables
        };
    };
```

RxDB will call the above method whenever a document is updated or a new document is created. RxDB will then fire the [GraphQL Query](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/graphql-queries/) returned along with the variables returned. In the above function the InsertTodo mutation tells hasura to try to insert the row only if a row with the same `id` does not already exist. If a row with the same `id` exists then Hasura will simply update the columns given in the `update_columns` field of that row.
