## Database Objects

Database objects are entities that hold data and its metadata.
In other words, an object is a data structure that is used to store or reference data.

Some of the object types that are contained in a schema are Databases, Tables, Views, Stored procedures, Indexes, Sequences, Constraints, Triggers, and Functions.

## What is a Database Schema

A *schema* is a collection of database objects. Schema is a collection of logical structures of data.

Database schema describes the structure of the data and how the data is related to each other.

Schema is also referred to as a named space of database objects. Each user owns a single schema. You can use the T-SQL commands to create and manipulate the objects in the schema.
