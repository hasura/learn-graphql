Congratulations! That brings us to the end of the GraphQL Tutorial. By now, you should have a good grasp of GraphQL concepts and terminologies to be able to get your hands dirty in trying out the Backend or Frontend.

In case you are wondering what to do next, we suggest the following:

## Take the Hasura backend course {#hasura-backend-course}
We have an [Introduction to Hasura](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) backend course to build the backend for a realtime todo app.

## Take the Frontend course {#frontend-course}
We have a bunch of frontend courses based on the framework of your choice.
- [React](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/react/introduction/)
- [Vue](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/vue/introduction/)
- [Angular](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/angular-apollo/introduction/)
- [Typescript React](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/typescript-react-apollo/introduction/)

## Join Discord for Support {#join-discord}
We have a Discord Channel for those who are new to GraphQL. Please post your queries or feedback regarding this course. It is a pretty active channel.

Here's the [invite link](https://discord.com/invite/hasura) to join Discord.

## More sample apps {#more-sample-apps}
We have a bunch of sample apps created using React, Apollo Client and Hasura GraphQL Engine.

Check out the [sample apps](https://hasura.io/sample-apps) to get a taste of how realtime GraphQL and Auth work with Hasura. We also have boilerplates to help you get started quickly with React and Apollo.
