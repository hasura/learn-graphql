Hasura gives you Instant GraphQL APIs over [Postgres](https://hasura.io/learn/database/postgresql/what-is-postgresql/), among other databases. Therefore, it can be tested on [the table that we just created](https://hasura.io/learn/database/postgresql/create-alter-drop-ddl/1-postgresql-create/).

Let's go ahead and start exploring the GraphQL API for `users` table. We are going to use GraphiQL to explore the API. GraphiQL is the GraphQL integrated development environment (IDE). It's a powerful tool we'll use to interact with the API.

You can access GraphiQL by heading over to Console -> API -> GraphiQL tab.

## Mutation {#mutation}

Let's add a user using a [GraphQL Mutation](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/graphql-queries/). Copy the following code into the GraphiQL interface.

```graphql
mutation {
  insert_users(objects:[{id: "1", name:"Praveen"}]) {
    affected_rows
  }
}
```

Click on the `Play` button on the GraphiQL interface to execute the query.

You should get a response looking something like this:

![User Mutation](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/graphql-mutation-user.png)

Great! You have now consumed the mutation query for the `users` table that you just created.

**Tip**: You can use the `Explorer` on the GraphiQL interface to generate the mutation in a few clicks.

## Query {#query}

Now let's go ahead and [query](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/queries/index/) the data that we just inserted.

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    created_at
  }
}
```

You should get a response looking something like this:

![User Query](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/graphql-query-user.png)

Note that some columns like `created_at` have default values, even though you did not insert them during the mutation.

## Subscription {#subscription}

Let's run a [subscription](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/subscriptions/index/) query over `users` table to watch for changes to the table.

```graphql
subscription {
  users {
    id
    name
    created_at
  }
}
```

Initially, the subscription query will return the existing results in the response.

Now let's insert new data into the `users` table and see the changes appearing in the response.

In a new browser tab, Head over to Console -> `DATA` tab -> default -> public -> users -> Insert Row and insert another row.

![Insert new user](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/user-insert-new-row.png)

And switch to the previous `GRAPHIQL` tab and see the subscription response returning 2 results.

![User Subscription](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/graphql-subscription-user.png)

An active subscription query will keep returning the latest set of results depending on the query.
