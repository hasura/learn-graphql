1. Navigate to the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/)
2. Signup / Login to the account
3. Create a new tenant.
4. Click on the `Applications` menu option on the left and then click the `+ Create Application` button.
5. In the Create Application window, set a name for your application and select `Single Page Web Applications`. (Assuming the frontend app will be a SPA built on react/vue etc)

## Create Auth0 API

We need to create an API on Auth0 so that we can make the `accessToken` a valid JWT. Click on the `APIs` section on the left sidebar and click on the `+ Create API` button.

Now in the pop-up that appears, give the name of the API and the identifier. We can technically give any value.

Let's say the name is `hasura` and the identifier is `https://hasura.io/learn`.

We can let the signing algorithm to be as it is. (RS256)

Click on Create once you are done.
