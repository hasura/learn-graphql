Now we saw how the GraphQL API can be extended using Actions. We mentioned earlier that another way of customizing the API graph is through a custom GraphQL server.

Let's take the same use-case of fetching profile information from Auth0.

Hasura can merge remote GraphQL schemas and provide a unified GraphQL API. To handle the use-case of fetching Auth0 profile information, we will write custom resolvers in a custom GraphQL server. Hasura can then merge this custom GraphQL server with the existing auto-generated schema. 

This custom GraphQL server is the `Remote Schema`.

## Write GraphQL custom resolver
So let's write a custom resolver which can be later merged into Hasura's GraphQL API.

```javascript
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
const gql = require('graphql-tag');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const fetch = require('node-fetch');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type auth0_profile {
    email: String
    picture: String
  }

  type Query {
    auth0: auth0_profile
  }
`;

function getProfileInfo(user_id) {
  const headers = {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.AUTH0_MANAGEMENT_API_TOKEN}`,
  };
  console.log(headers);

  return fetch(`https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/api/v2/users/${user_id}`, {
    headers,
  });
}

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    auth0: (parent, args, context) => {
      // read the authorization header sent from the client
      const authHeaders = context.headers.authorization || '';
      const token = authHeaders.replace('Bearer ', '');

      // decode the token to find the user_id
      try {
        if (!token) {
          return 'Authorization token is missing!';
        }

        const decoded = jwt.decode(token);
        const user_id = decoded.sub;

        // make a rest api call to auth0
        return getProfileInfo(user_id)
          .then((resp) => resp.json())
          .then((resp) => {
            console.log(resp);
            if (!resp) {
              return null;
            }

            return { email: resp.email, picture: resp.picture };
          });
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
        return null;
      }
    },
  },
};

const context = ({ req }) => {
  return { headers: req.headers };
};

const schema = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers, context });
schema.listen({ port: process.env.PORT }).then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`schema ready at ${url}`);
});

```

In the server above, let's breakdown what's happening:

- We define the GraphQL types for `auth0_profile` and `Query`. 
- And then we write a custom resolver for Query type `auth0`, where we parse the `Authorization` headers to get the token. 
- We then decode the token using the `jsonwebtoken` library's `jwt` method. This gives the user_id required to fetch auth0 profile information.
- We request the [Auth0's Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/create-m2m-app), passing in the token and the user_id to get details about this user.
- Once we get a response, we return the object `{email: resp.email, picture: resp.picture}` as a response. Else, we return `null`.

**Note**
Most of the code written is very similar to the REST API code we wrote in the previous section for Actions. Here we are using Apollo Server to write a custom GraphQL server from scratch.
If you have created `auth0` Action from `Creating Actions` part, then Action will collide with auth0 Remote schema. To solve this you can remove Action to be able to create Remote schema or rename `auth0` and `auth0_profile` types.

## Deploy 

Let's deploy the above custom GraphQL server to Glitch. Glitch is a platform to build and deploy apps (Node.js) and is a quick way to test and iterate code on the cloud. Click on the Deploy to Glitch button below to get started.

[![DEPLOY TO GLITCH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/community/boilerplates/auth-webhooks/nodejs-express/assets/deploy-glitch.png)](https://glitch.com/~auth0-hasura-remote-schema)

### Environment variables
After remixing to your own project on Glitch, modify the `.env` file to enter the 
- `AUTH0_MANAGEMENT_API_TOKEN`
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN` 

values appropriately.

Congrats! You have written and deployed your first GraphQL custom resolver.
