This course is for Hasura users who want to optimize their applications for production use cases. If you are new to Hasura, head to the [Hasura Basics](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) tutorial to set up a Hasura project and learn how to leverage the fundamental features before diving into this tutorial.

## What will I learn? {#what-will-i-learn}

This course will dive into advanced topics and walk you through using different Hasura Cloud features. You will learn how Hasura Cloud helps you go to production with advanced security and reliability features. The topics covered are:
1. Migrations and Metadata
2. Optimizing for Performance
3. Enhancing Security
4. Improving Reliability
5. Debugging

## What do I need to take this tutorial? {#what-do-i-need}

Some demos use a local Hasura instance; hence, `docker / docker-compose` is a prerequisite. And, of course, your browser for managing the Hasura Cloud project. However, be assured that everything you do via the browser in this tutorial can be done via code and can be version controlled if required.

We will use the Hasura CLI to learn about the migrations and metadata workflow, but we will set that up during that exercise.

## How long will this tutorial take? {#how-long}

We expect this to take about an hour.

*Note*: Some performance, security, and reliability features are available only on Hasura Cloud. The open-source graphql-engine can be used for local development portions of this tutorial.
