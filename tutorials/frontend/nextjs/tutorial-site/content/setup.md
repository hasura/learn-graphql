For this tutorial, the GraphQL backend and the basic app UI is already ready.
Our task will be to convert the "static" UI into a working realtime app in Next.js

### Clone and run the boilerplate

1. Clone the [learn-graphql](https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql) repo. Execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --sparse git@github.com:hasura/learn-graphql.git

cd learn-graphql

git sparse-checkout init --cone

git sparse-checkout add tutorials/frontend/nextjs
```

2. Navigate to the `app-boilerplate` directory.

```bash
cd tutorials/frontend/nextjs/app-boilerplate
```

3. Install dependencies and run the "static" app
    - `yarn install`
    - `yarn dev`

### Configure the environment variables

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the values for Auth0.

The `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` are available in your Auth0 application settings and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET` can be any random string of at least 32 characters and it is used to encrypt the cookie. Enter the Identifier found from your Auth0 API settings to `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`.

```
DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=https://hasura.io/learn
AUTH0_DOMAIN=
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=
REDIRECT_URI=/api/callback
POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/
SESSION_COOKIE_SECRET=
```

Do note that, the value of `AUTH0_DOMAIN` should be a full URL including the `https://` prefix as required.

This is what you should see after the steps above:
