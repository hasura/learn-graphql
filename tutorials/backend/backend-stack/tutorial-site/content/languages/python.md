## What is Python

Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively. Learn more at [the official website](https://www.python.org/).

The following guide covers common backend application tasks using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and how they can tie into Hasura.

> New to Hasura? The Hasura GraphQL Engine makes your data instantly accessible over a real-time GraphQL API so that you can build and ship modern, performant apps and APIs 10x faster. Hasura connects to your databases, REST and GraphQL endpoints, and third-party APIs to provide a unified, connected, real-time, secured GraphQL API for all your data. Check out [the documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/index/).

See the [the server source code on Github](https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql/backend/backend-stack/tutorial-site/source-code/python).

## Create Python REST Endpoint

We will create a login POST endpoint that takes a username and password and returns an access code.

In our `main.py`, we use FastAPI to create an HTTP server:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from typing import Generic, TypeVar
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.generics import GenericModel
from action.loginTypes import LoginResponse, loginArgs
from event.event import Payload
from remoteSchema.remoteSchema import graphql_app
from qlient.aiohttp import AIOHTTPClient, GraphQLResponse

ActionInput = TypeVar("ActionInput", bound=BaseModel | None)


class ActionName(BaseModel):
    name: str


class ActionPayload(GenericModel, Generic[ActionInput]):
    action: ActionName
    input: ActionInput
    request_query: str
    session_variables: dict[str, str]


app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/action")
async def actionHandler(action: ActionPayload[loginArgs]) -> LoginResponse:
    action.input
    return LoginResponse(AccessToken="<sample value>")
```

In `action/action.py`, we create the handler:

```python
from enum import Enum, auto
from pydantic import BaseModel


class LoginResponse(BaseModel):
    AccessToken: str


class Mutation(BaseModel):
    login: LoginResponse | None


class loginArgs(BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
```

Install the dependencies and run the app

```bash
pip install "fastapi[all]"

uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Hasura Action

We can integrate this endpoint into Hasura and generate the code using [Hasura Actions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/actions/index/). In the Actions tab on the Hasura Console we will set up a custom login function

```graphql
type Mutation {
  login(username: String!, password: String!): LoginResponse
}
```

New types definition:

```graphql
type LoginResponse {
  AccessToken: String!
}
```

Create the action, click the `Codegen` tab, and select `python-fast-api`.

Copy `login.py` to `main.py` and `loginTypes.py` in your project.

In the Hasura API explorer tab you should now be able to test it

```graphql
mutation {
  login(password: "password", username: "username") {
    AccessToken
  }
}
```

Result:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "login": {
      "AccessToken": "<sample value>"
    }
  }
}
```

### Event Triggers

With [Hasura event triggers](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/event-triggers/index/) we can get notified whenever an event happens in our database.

Let's send a webhook when a new user is created and print out their name.

1.  In the Hasura Console add a `user` table with a `Text` column `name` and the frequently used `UUID` column id.

1.  In the event trigger tab, on the `user` table, check the insert and via console trigger operations.

1.  The event trigger payload schema can be found [in the docs](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/event-triggers/payload/#json-payload). We make pydantic classes in Python to represent this

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
    from pydantic.generics import GenericModel
    from typing import Generic, Literal, TypeVar

    New = TypeVar("New", bound=BaseModel | None)
    Old = TypeVar("Old", bound=BaseModel | None)


    class DeliveryInfo(BaseModel):
        current_retry: int
        max_retries: int


    class Data(GenericModel, Generic[New, Old]):
        new: New
        old: Old


    class TraceContext(BaseModel):
        span_id: str
        trace_id: str


    class Event(GenericModel, Generic[New, Old]):
        data: Data[New, Old]
        op: Literal["INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE", "MANUAL"]
        session_variables: dict[str, str]
        trace_context: TraceContext


    class Table(BaseModel):
        name: str
        schema_: str = Field("", alias="schema")


    class Trigger(BaseModel):
        name: str


    class Payload(GenericModel, Generic[New, Old]):
        created_at: str
        delivery_info: DeliveryInfo
        event: Event[New, Old]
        id: str
        table: Table
        trigger: Trigger

    ```

1.  Now we make an HTTP handler that handles the event

    ```python
    from event import Payload
    class UserTable(BaseModel):
      id: str
      name: str


    @app.post("/event")
    async def actionHandler(action: Payload[UserTable, None]):
        return
    ```

When you add a user in Hasura your Python server should receive the event.

## Create Python GraphQL Server

We can make a custom GraphQL server in Python using [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/) and connect it to Hasura using a [remote schema](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index/).

1. Run the [Strawberry FastAPI quickstart](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/fastapi)

1. In `remoteSchema/remoteSchema.py` add the Strawberry code

   ```python
   import strawberry
   from strawberry.fastapi import GraphQLRouter


   @strawberry.type
   class Query:
       @strawberry.field
       def hello(self) -> str:
         return "Hello World"


   schema = strawberry.Schema(Query)

   graphql_app = GraphQLRouter(schema)
   ```

1. Add the generated GraphQL handler to `main.py`

   ```python
   from remoteSchema.remoteSchema import graphql_app


   app.include_router(graphql_app, prefix="/graphql")
   ```

### Hasura Remote Schema

We can connect our custom GraphQL server to Hasura using [remote schemas](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index/).

1. In the Hasura Console remote schema tab, add your Python server `<Python server URL>/graphql`

1. In the API Explorer tab, try querying the sample todos.

   ```graphql
   {
     hello
   }
   ```

## Query GraphQL from Python

To query a GraphQL endpoint from Python we use the async version of [qlient](https://github.com/qlient-org/python-qlient).

1. Install qlient

   ```bash
   pip install qlient.aiohttp
   ```

1. Query all users in the event trigger handler we created earlier,

   ```python
   @app.post("/event")
   async def actionHandler(action: Payload   [UserTable, None]):
       async with AIOHTTPClient("http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql") as client:
           result: GraphQLResponse = await client.query.user(["id", "name"])
           print(result.request.query)
           print(result.data)
       return
   ```

## Conclusion

When developing backend applications, we may need to write custom business logic. When we use Hasura, it autogenerates most of our API but gives us escape hatches for this custom logic. We've gone over a few ways you can use the power of Python. Enjoy!
