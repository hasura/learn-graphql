After getting this page sorted, you'll be off to the races. This set of one-time setup steps will get you ready to start
building your Hasura project.

## Install the Hasura CLI {#hasura-cli}

We've redesigned the Hasura CLI from the ground up to make it easier to use and more powerful. Follow the
[install instructions from the docs](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation/) for your platform. **Please note,
this is a new CLI and is not the same as the previous version.**

## Install the VS Code extension {#vs-code-extensions}

We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and installing the Hasura VS Code extension. It allows you
to instantly scaffold out your metadata ðŸš€

You can download the extension from the
[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura).

## Authenticate your CLI {#cli-auth}

To authenticate your CLI to our network, run the following command:

```bash
ddn auth login
```

This will open a browser window where you can log in with your Hasura account. Once you've logged in, you can close the
browser window and return to your terminal.

## Our data model

In this tutorial, we'll be building the data layer for an e-commerce application. We'll use the following data model,
which we'll connect to our project in the next section:
