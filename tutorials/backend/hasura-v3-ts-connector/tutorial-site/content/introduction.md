metaDescription: 'Learn how to build a data connector for Hasura DDN'
---

In this course we will go through the process of creating a Hasura DDN data connector in TypeScript step-by-step.

Data connectors allow us to target arbitrary data sources and bring their data into our Hasura graph.

## What will we be building? {#what-will-we-be-building}

We will build a basic connector to an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) file-system database which you can 
run locally on your machine. 

This will familiarize you with the process of creating a connector to the Hasura DDN specification. You can then 
take the concepts you've learned and apply them to any data source you'd like to integrate with Hasura DDN.

## How do I follow along? {#how-do-I-follow-along}

You can follow along with the code in this tutorial by first cloning the [repo](/get-started/01-clone/).

## What will I learn? {#what-will-i-learn}

You'll learn the fundamentals of creating a basic data connector with the 
[TypeScript Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript). You can then take what you've learned 
into creating a data connector for any data source. 

## What do I need to take this tutorial? {#what-do-i-need-to-take-this-tutorial}

It is recommended that you first review the [Hasura NDC Specification](http://hasura.github.io/ndc-spec/), at least to 
gain a basic familiarity with the concepts, but this course is intended to be complementary to the spec.

The dependencies required to follow along here are minimal:
- you will need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) with `npm` so that you can run the TypeScript compiler. 
- If you'd like to follow along using the same test-driven approach, then you will also need a working `ndc-test` 
  executable on your `PATH`.

`ndc-test` can be installed using the Rust toolchain from the [`ndc-spec`](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec) repository.

## How long will this tutorial take? {#how-long-will-this-tutorial-take}

About an hour.
